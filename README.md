# Code Refactor Starter Code
## refactored code to consolidate and improve accessability.

Our client wanted us to refactor the original code for this webpage. It had sevreal sections that were redundant that were consolidated in the CSS. The HTML was also much longer than it needed to be. We re-grouped and re-coigured the HTML to make it easier to follow. 

In HTML:
 The lists in the header section were put in-line to give an easier look.
 The main sections were given a section class that made the CSS easier to implement. 
 The footer was changed from (h2) to (h4) to ensure its place on the page, while keeping the overall style in CSS.
 
 In CSS:
 Changing the div to one uniform div class of (benifit) was used to eliminate a few of the unnecessary constructs for styling.
